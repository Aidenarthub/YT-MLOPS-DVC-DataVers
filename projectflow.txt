1. Create git repo adn clone it in local
2. Create code.py and add code to it.(it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc.
# pip install dvc (if it is not installed)
4. Now we do " dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
5. Now do "mkdir S3" (creates a new s3 directory)
6. Now we do " dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
7. Next "dvc add data/"
Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
Because initialization we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.

8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
